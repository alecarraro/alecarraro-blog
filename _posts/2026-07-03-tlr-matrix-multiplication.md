## Introduction: TLR `GEMM`

Let $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$$ be a square matrix stored in tile low-rank (TLR) format. We  partition $$A$$ into an $$n \times n$$ grid of tiles,

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
A_{11} & \widetilde A_{12} & \cdots & \widetilde A_{1n} \\
\widetilde A_{21} & A_{22} & \cdots & \widetilde A_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\widetilde A_{n1} & \widetilde A_{n2} & \cdots & A_{nn}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

The diagonal tiles $$A_{ii}$$ are stored densely; each off-diagonal tile ($$i \neq j$$) is stored in compressed low-rank form

$$
\widetilde A_{ij} = U_{ij} V_{ij}^{T}, \qquad U_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^{b_i \times r_{ij}}, \quad V_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^{b_j \times r_{ij}},
$$

where $$r_{ij}$$ is the tile rank. Interior tiles are $$b \times b$$; boundary tiles are smaller when $$N$$ is not a multiple of $$b$$.

We want the generalized product

$$
C \leftarrow \alpha \operatorname{op}(A)\operatorname{op}(B) + \beta C, \qquad \operatorname{op}(X) \in \{X, X^{T}\},
$$

where each of $$A$$, $$B$$, $$C$$ may be stored densely or in TLR format. The tile factors can be stored padded to occupy $$b\times r_{\max}$$ even if the efefctive rank $$r_{ij} < r_{\max}$$ or with variable storage such that each tile only takes $$r_{ij} $$. The second one requires more complex scheduling. We develop the general GEMM $$\mathrm{TLR}\times \mathrm{TLR}\rightarrow \mathrm{TLR}$$ in three steps, from the easiest to the most complex, building on each other.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\text{1. fixed rank:} \qquad &&\text{dense} \leftarrow \text{TLR} \times \text{TLR}, \\
&\text{2. fixed rank:} \qquad &&\text{TLR} \leftarrow \text{TLR} \times \text{TLR}, \\
&\text{3. variable rank:} \qquad &&\text{TLR} \leftarrow \text{TLR} \times \text{TLR}.
\end{aligned}
$$

This post describes stage 1, the fixed-rank dense-output case; the TLR-output cases extend it.

## Fixed Rank `GEMM`:  $$\mathrm{ dense} \leftarrow \mathrm{TLR}\times \mathrm{TLR}$$

The goal of the first implementation stage is to compute

$$
C \leftarrow AB,
$$

where both $$A$$ and $$B$$ are stored in fixed-rank TLR format and $$C$$ is stored densely. The main implementation objective is to express the computation in terms of vendor-optimized BLAS primitives, in particular `GEMM` and batched `GEMM` variants.

To expose regular operations, we need to analyse the memory storage. TLR matrix can be stored using three buffers, one for the dense diagonal tile, represented by a 3d array of size $$b\times b \times n$$ such that each tile is written in memory in the (Julia standard) column major storage. Similarly the factors $$U$$ and $$V$$ can also be written in memory in two distinct buffers, where each factor is laid out column major and the factors are stored linearized according to either a tile row major or tile col major ordering. In the case where the tiles have the same blocksize $$b$$ and rank $$r_{\max}$$, there is a constant stride among consecutive factors and can be written as a 3d array as well. 

<figure>

</figure>

In the more general case, where we store the arrays with variable ranks, we also hold an array with the ranks $$r$$ and compute its starting location in the buffer by prefix sum.

For the case the global matrix dimension $$N$$ is not an exact multiple of the nominal tile size $$b$$. Let

$$
N = mb + b_{\mathrm{rem}},
$$

where $$m = \lfloor N/b \rfloor$$ and $$0 \leq b_{\mathrm{rem}} < b$$. If $$b_{\mathrm{rem}} = 0$$, all tiles have size $$b \times b$$. Otherwise, the last block row and last block column contain boundary tiles with smaller dimensions. In that case, the interior part of the matrix has dimension $$mb \times mb$$, while the boundary block has size $$b_{\mathrm{rem}}$$.

For this reason, it is convenient to decompose the matrix into a regular interior TLR (sub)matrix and then three boundary panels. When $$b_{\mathrm{rem}} > 0$$, we write

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
A_{\mathrm{int}} & u_A \\
v_A^{T} & \gamma_A
\end{bmatrix},
$$

where

$$
A_{\mathrm{int}} \in \mathbb{R}^{mb \times mb}, 
\qquad
u_A \in \mathbb{R}^{mb \times b_{\mathrm{rem}}},
\qquad
v_A \in \mathbb{R}^{mb \times b_{\mathrm{rem}}},
\qquad
\gamma_A \in \mathbb{R}^{b_{\mathrm{rem}} \times b_{\mathrm{rem}}}.
$$

Here, $$A_{\mathrm{int}}$$ denotes the regular TLR sub-matrix formed by the full-size tiles, while $$u_A$$, $$v_A^{T}$$, and $$\gamma_A$$ collect the boundary column, boundary row, and bottom-right corner block, respectively. So the storage becomes as in the figure below

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/tlr-gemm/tlr-bnd-storage.png' | relative_url }}"  width="800">
</figure>

The right operand $$B$$ in the TLR `GEMM` can have the same structure. Then the product $$C = AB$$ can be written as

$$
\begin{aligned}
C &=
\begin{bmatrix}
A_{\mathrm{int}} & u_A \\
v_A^{T} & \gamma_A
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
B_{\mathrm{int}} & u_B \\
v_B^{T} & \gamma_B
\end{bmatrix} \\
&=
\begin{bmatrix}
A_{\mathrm{int}} B_{\mathrm{int}} & A_{\mathrm{int}} u_B \\
v_A^{T} B_{\mathrm{int}} & v_A^{T} u_B
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
u_A v_B^{T} & u_A \gamma_B \\
\gamma_A v_B^{T} & \gamma_A \gamma_B
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{aligned}
$$

This decomposition separates the computation into four output regions:

$$
C =
\begin{bmatrix}
C_{\mathrm{int}} & C_{\mathrm{right}} \\
C_{\mathrm{bottom}} & C_{\mathrm{corner}}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

This structure is allows to split the matrix-multiplication across terms with a regular structure, which maps well to (batched) `GEMM`s. The bulk of the work is the update of the interior block $$A_{\mathrm{int}} B_{\mathrm{int}}$$. Moreover since, the the four ouput regions are dijsoint they can be updated concurrently on separate streams.

We explain the machinery developed to compute the interior product $$A_{\mathrm{int}} B_{\mathrm{int}}$$, as this is the most computationally intensive operation and the most general. The same ideas are reused for the other products

### Regular TLR `GEMM`

From here on we drop the $$\mathrm{int}$$ subscript and work with two square interior TLR sub-matrices. The storage naturally splits each operand into its dense diagonal and its low-rank off-diagonal part, $$A = D_A + O_A$$ and $$B = D_B + O_B$$, so that

$$
C \leftarrow \beta C + \alpha (D_A + O_A)(D_B + O_B)
      = \beta C + \alpha\big(D_A D_B + O_A D_B + D_A O_B + O_A O_B\big).
$$

The four products touch different parts of $$C_{\mathrm{int}}$$:

- $$D_A D_B$$ writes only the **diagonal** tiles of $$C$$;
- $$O_A D_B$$ and $$D_A O_B$$ write only the **off-diagonal** tiles;
- $$O_A O_B$$ writes **both**, and usually accounts for the dominant part of the work

Because the diagonal group and the off-diagonal group touch disjoint tiles, they can run concurrently on separate streams

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/tlr-gemm/streams-diags.png' | relative_url }}" width="800">
</figure>

The scaling by $$\beta$$ is fused into the first GEMM that writes each tile of $$C$$. For a diagonal tile $$C_{ii}$$, the first writer is $$D_A D_B$$, so that GEMM performs

$$
C_{ii} \leftarrow \beta C_{ii} + \alpha A_{ii}B_{ii}.
$$

For an off-diagonal tile $$C_{ij}$$, the first writer is either the $$O_A D_B$$ update or the $$D_A O_B$$ update. That first off-diagonal GEMM uses the original $$\beta$$. Every later contribution to the same tile uses accumulation mode, i.e. it is launched with $$\beta = 1$$. 

#### The easy terms

The first three products are mapped to strided batched GEMMs. The diagonal product is a batch of independent dense tile GEMMs:

$$
(D_A D_B)_{ii} = A_{ii}B_{ii},
\qquad i = 1,\dots,m.
$$

Thus it is implemented as one strided batched GEMM with matrix size $$b \times b$$ and batch size $$m$$.

The product $$O_A D_B$$ can be written as

$$
(O_A D_B)*{ij} = U*{ij}\big(V_{ij}^{T}D_{jj}\big),
\qquad i\neq j,
$$

and is therefore evaluated in two batched GEMM stages. Consider first the products $$V_{ij}^{T}D_{jj}$$ over all off-diagonal tiles. The GEMM grouping depends on the layout of the low-rank factors. If the factors of $$A$$ are stored tile-column major, then for each fixed $$j$$ the matrices $$V_{ij}^{T}$$, $$i\neq j$$, are contiguous and can be stacked into one tall matrix. Thus the $$m-1$$ products associated with column $$j$$ are computed by one GEMM of size $$((m-1)r)\times b$$ times $$b\times b$$. Repeating this for all $$j$$ gives $$m$$ such GEMMs, which can be launched as one strided batched GEMM. If the factors of $$A$$ are stored row-wise instead, the factors needed for a fixed $$j$$ are not contiguous, so this aggregation is not available; the stage is then implemented as one small GEMM per off-diagonal tile, for a total of $$m(m-1)$$ GEMMs of size $$r\times b$$ times $$b\times b$$.

  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/tlr-gemm/offdiag_x_diag.png' | relative_url }}"  width="800">
</figure>


By symmetry, the opposite holds for the product $$D_A * O_B$$.

#### The $$O_A O_B$$ terms
Here both operands are low-rank. With $$\widetilde A_{ik} = U_{ik} V_{ik}^{T}$$ and $$\widetilde B_{kj} = W_{kj} Z_{kj}^{T}$$, the $$(i,j)$$ output block is

$$
(O_A O_B)_{ij}
=
\sum_{k\neq i,j}
U_{ik}\,\bigl(V_{ik}^{T}W_{kj}\bigr)\,Z_{kj}^{T}.
$$

We first compute the common intermediate

$$
\text{Stage 1:}\qquad
S_{ikj}=V_{ik}^{T}W_{kj}
\in\mathbb{R}^{r_A\times r_B}.
$$

The remaining contractions are ordered to minimize the size of the intermediate matrix. Specifically,

- If $$r_A\le r_B$$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Stage 2:}\qquad
&T_{ikj}=S_{ikj}Z_{kj}^{T}
&&\in\mathbb{R}^{r_A\times b},\\
\text{Stage 3:}\qquad
&C_{ij}=\sum_k U_{ik}T_{ikj}
&&\in\mathbb{R}^{b\times b}.
\end{aligned}
$$

- If $$r_B<r_A$$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Stage 2:}\qquad
&T_{ikj}=U_{ik}S_{ikj}
&&\in\mathbb{R}^{b\times r_B},\\
\text{Stage 3:}\qquad
&C_{ij}=\sum_k T_{ikj}Z_{kj}^{T}
&&\in\mathbb{R}^{b\times b}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, after forming $$S_{ikj}$$, the multiplication order is chosen according to $$\min(r_A,r_B)$$, ensuring that the intermediate matrix $$T_{ikj}$$ is as small as possible.

Each stage is a collection of small GEMMs indexed by three tile indices: the output row $$i$$, the output column $$j$$, and the contraction tile $$k$$. As in the previous section, the number and size of the GEMM depends on the layout of the factors. Every index can be handled in three cases:

1. **Fused** into a GEMM dimension (M, N, or K): several tiles are glued into one larger matrix operand and handled by a single large GEMM. This is fastest, but requires the tiles along a given axis to be **contiguous in memory**
2. **Batched**: many independent, equal-shaped GEMMs issued in one batched-GEMM call. This works for any layout, but each GEMM stays small.
3. **Looped** serially, one GEMM per value of the index.

Fusing is best (biggest GEMMs, fewest launches), batching is the fallback for scattered data, and looping is reserved for a case we will see is unavoidable. The axes which can be fused depends on the ordering of the factors: tile column or tile major order.

##### The stride-1 axis

The factors are stored as $$[b, r, n_{\text{off}}]$$ arrays. Tiles are contiguous in memory only along the stride-1 axis, which depends on the tile layout.

| Operand | Tile-column-major | Tile-row-major |
|:--------|:-----------------:|:--------------:|
|$$A_{ik}$$ |$$i$$ |$$k$$ |
|$$B_{kj}$$ |$$k$$ |$$j$$ |

This gives four possible layout combinations, which determines the optimization lever.

##### Lever 1: $$A$$'s layout determines how the $$k$$-sum is performed

First consider one fixed output tile $$C_{ij}$$. Its low-rank update has the form

$$
C_{ij}
\mathrel{+}=
\sum_{k\neq i,j}
U_{ik}T_{ikj},
$$

where $$T_{ikj}$$ is the intermediate produced by the previous stage. The important point is that all values of $$k$$ contribute to the same output tile $$C_{ij}$$. There are two ways to handle this sum:

If the factors $$U_{ik}$$ are contiguous in $$k$$, we can fold the $$k$$-sum into the GEMM contraction dimension. Namely, for fixed $$(i,j)$$ we form the block products as

$$
C_{ij}
\mathrel{+}=
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
U_{i1} & U_{i2} & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}
}_{b\times K_r}
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
T_{i1j}\\
T_{i2j}\\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}
}_{K_r\times b},
$$

where $$K_r$$ is the sum of the ranks over the contributing $$k$$ indices. In this case one GEMM computes the full sum over $$k$$ and writes $$C_{ij}$$ once. In this case the GEMM has the schematic form. This is the **write-once** case for $$C_{ij}$$.

<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/tlr-gemm/stage3.png' | relative_url }}"  width="600">
</figure>


If the factors $$U_{ik}$$ are not contiguous in $$k$$, folding the reduction into one GEMM would require packing or copying the $$U$$ panels. Without such packing, the implementation loops over $$k$$:

$$
\begin{cases}
C_{ij} \leftarrow U_{ik}T_{ikj} + \beta C_{ij} && k=1 \\
C_{ij} +=   U_{ik}T_{ikj} && k=2, \dots, n-1
\end{cases}
$$

Now each contribution is a separate GEMM, and the same tile $$C_{ij}$$ is updated repeatedly. This is the **accumulate** case.

Thus:

* If $$A$$ is stride-1 in $$k$$, then the $$U_{ik}$$ panels needed for one $$C_{ij}$$ are contiguous. The $$k$$-sum can be folded into the GEMM contraction dimension, and each output tile $$C_{ij}$$ is written once.
* If $$A$$ is stride-1 in $$i$$, then the $$U_{ik}$$ panels needed for one $$C_{ij}$$ are scattered as $$k$$ varies. The implementation loops over $$k$$ and accumulates into $$C_{ij}$$ multiple times.

This statement concerns one fixed output tile. Across many output tiles, we still batch or loop over the remaining free indices. For example, if the $$k$$-sum has been folded for each $$(i,j)$$, then different output tiles $$C_{ij}$$ are independent and can be handled as a batch of write-once GEMMs. If the $$k$$-sum is not folded, then the implementation typically loops over $$k$$, and for each fixed $$k$$ updates a batch of output tiles $$C_{ij}$$ with accumulation.

This is why the two scheduling families differ in their traffic to $$C$$. In the write-once family, each $$C_{ij}$$ tile is formed by a GEMM that already includes the full $$k$$-sum. In the accumulate family, each $$C_{ij}$$ tile is read and written once per contributing $$k$$. Since Stage 3 operates on full $$b\times b$$ tiles, reducing the number of updates to $$C$$ is usually the dominant consideration.

##### Lever 2: $$B$$'s layout determines whether Stage 1 fuses over $$j$$

Stage 1 computes $$S_{ikj}=V_{ik}^{T}W_{kj}$$. For fixed $$(i,k)$$, the left operand $$V_{ik}^{T}$$ is reused for all output columns $$j$$, while the right operand $$W_{kj}$$ changes with $$j$$. Therefore, if the $$W_{kj}$$ factors are contiguous as $$j$$ varies, the products over $$j$$ can be fused into the $$N$$ dimension of one larger GEMM.

If $$B$$ is stride-1 in $$j$$, then the row-$$k$$ panel

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
W_{k j_1} & W_{k j_2} & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}
$$

is contiguous, and Stage 1 can compute

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
S_{ikj_1} & S_{ikj_2} & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}
=

V_{ik}^{T}
\begin{bmatrix}
W_{k j_1} & W_{k j_2} & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Thus $$j$$ is fused into the GEMM $$N$$ dimension. This replaces many small $$r_A\times r_B$$ products by one wider GEMM.
<figure>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/tlr-gemm/stage1_fuse.png' | relative_url }}"  width="600">
</figure>


If $$B$$ is stride-1 in $$k$$, then the factors $$W_{kj}$$ needed for fixed $$k$$ and varying $$j$$ are scattered. The fusion over $$j$$ is not available without packing, so Stage 1 remains tilewise and is implemented as a batched GEMM.

The same idea applies to the $$i$$ direction. For fixed $$k$$ the factors $$V_{ik}^{T}$$ are contiguous as $$i$$ varies, then stage 1 can then fuse $$i$$ into the GEMM $$M$$ dimension.

Combining the two levers gives the four layouts:

| $$A$$ stride-1 axis | $$B$$ stride-1 axis | $$k$$-reduction               | Stage-1 fusion      |   # (batched) GEMMs |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | --------: |
| $$k$$               | $$j$$               | folded into $$K$$; write-once | $$j\to N$$          |     $$3$$ |
| $$k$$               | $$k$$               | folded into $$K$$; write-once | none; tilewise      |     $$3$$ |
| $$i$$               | $$k$$               | looped over $$k$$; accumulate | $$i\to M$$          | $$2+n$$ |
| $$i$$               | $$j$$               | looped over $$k$$; accumulate | $$i\to M,\ j\to N$$ | $$2+n$$ |

Here $$n_k$$ is the number of contraction tiles. The count refers to batched-GEMM launches for the $$O_AO_B$$ term. In the write-once family, the computation uses three batched GEMM stages: one for Stage 1, one for Stage 2, and one for the final update to $$C$$. In the accumulate family, the first two stages can still be grouped, but the final update must be performed once per contraction tile $$k$$, giving $$2+n_k$$ GEMM launches.

##### Output traversal and workspace budget

The previous discussion determines how the computation should be traversed. For each output tile $$C_{ij}$$, the intermediates $$S_{ikj}$$ and $$T_{ikj}$$ must be stored, or at least produced in a workspace large enough to feed the next GEMM stage. With a limited workspace budget for $$S$$ and $$T$$, the goal is to choose the largest panel of output tiles that can be processed without spilling or excessive packing.

The best traversal depends on whether the $$k$$-reduction can be folded into the final GEMM.

In the **write-once family**, $$A$$ is stride-1 in $$k$$. For fixed output row $$i$$, the factors $$U_{ik}$$ are contiguous as $$k$$ varies, so the whole $$k$$-sum can be folded into the GEMM contraction dimension. Thus, for a fixed row $$i$$ and a block of output columns $$J$$, Stage 3 has the form

$$
C_{iJ}
\mathrel{+}=
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
U_{ik_1} & U_{ik_2} & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}
}_{b\times K_r}
\underbrace{
\begin{bmatrix}
T_{ik_1J}\\
T_{ik_2J}\\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}
}_{K_r\times |J|b},
$$

where $$K_r$$ is the total rank over the contributing $$k$$ indices. Increasing $$J$$ increases the $$N$$ dimension of this GEMM and improves throughput. Thus the natural traversal order for $$C$$ is row by row. If the workspace is large enough, then several output rows $$i\in I$$ can be processed at once, giving a batched GEMM over the row block $$I$$.

In the **accumulate family**, $$A$$ is stride-1 in $$i$$. The axis $k$ is fused in Stage 1 and to increase the size of the GEMM we can compute $$S_{Ikj}$$ for a set of rows $$I$$, so the computation proceeds column-by-column. Here the key workspace decision is different. Since the final update is serial in $$k$$, a deeper block of contraction indices increases the number of times the same $$C$$ tile is read and written before moving on. Consequently, under a limited workspace budget, it is more effective to keep the active $$k$$-block small and allocate the remaining workspace to enlarging the free output dimension $$J$$. In practice, this means fixing a single $$k$$ at a time and partially updating as many $$C_{ij}$$ tiles as possible, processing tile columns first

##### Pseudocode
##### Pseudocode

The write-once (row) family, at full budget:

```
# A stride-1 in k  ⇒  U_ik, V_ik contiguous over k for a fixed row i
# scratch:  S[r, r, n, |J|, |I|]     T[r, n, b, |J|, |I|]

for run (block of rows I × columns J) sized to the budget:

    # Stage 1 — S_ikj = V_ik^T W_kj,  batched over (i, k, j)
    #   B stride-1 j: j fused into N   |   B stride-1 k: tilewise
    batched_gemm('T','N',  1, V[i,k], W[k,j],  0, S[i,k,j])

    # Stage 2 — T_ikj = S_ikj Z_kj^T,  batched over (i, k, j)
    batched_gemm('N','T',  1, S[i,k,j], Z[k,j],  0, T[i,k,j])

    # Stage 3 — fold k into K: one write per output row i, batched over i
    for i in I:                                 # collected into ONE batched call
        Ustack_i = [ U_i1 | U_i2 | … | U_in ]   #  b × n·r   (contiguous view)
        Tstack_i = reshape(T[i, :, :, J])       #  n·r × |J|·b
    batched_gemm('N','N',  α, Ustack, Tstack,  β=1, C[I, J])
```

The accumulate (column) family, at full budget:

```
# A stride-1 in i  ⇒  V_ik contiguous over i  (i fuses into M)
# k cannot fold into K, so it is a serial loop in Stage 3

for run (block of contraction tiles K × columns J) sized to the budget:

    # Stage 1 — batched over (k, j); i fused into M (and j into N if B stride-1 j)
    batched_gemm('T','N',  1, Vpanel[k], W[k,j],  0, S[k,j])

    # Stage 2 — batched over (k, j)
    batched_gemm('N','T',  1, S[k,j], Z[k,j],  0, T[k,j])

    # Stage 3 — the reduction: loop k, accumulate (β=1); batch the free axes (i,j)
    for k in K:
        batched_gemm('N','N',  α, U[:,k], T[k],  β=1, C[:, :])   # distinct (i,j) tiles
```
