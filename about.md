<p class="message">
  Hi, Iâ€™m Alessandro Carraro. I am a 2nd-year Masterâ€™s student at KTH and TU Delft, enrolled in the joint programme Computer Simulation for Science and Engineering (COSSE)

  As a part of my education, I have followed courses on numerical methods, scientific and graph machine learning, and control theory.  

  In my free time, I contribute to the <a href="https://juliareach.github.io/">JuliaReach</a> ecosystem, an open-source framework specialized in reachability analysis for dynamical systems.
